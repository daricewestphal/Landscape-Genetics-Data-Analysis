# Genetic Diversity {.imageChapter}

<div class="chapter_image"><img src="media/ch_milkweedbug.jpg"></div>

At a base level, genetic diversity is the fundamental components upon which evolution operates. Without diversity, there is no evolution and as such species cannot respond to selective pressure. Genetic diversity is a property of sampling locales.  It is created and maintained by demographic and evolutionary processes and the history of the organisms being examined.  It is also used as a surrogate measure for the consequences of several microevolutionary processes. In this section, we will examine how to estimate genetic diversity within a sample of individuals.

Estimates of within genetic diversity depend solely upon what you consider 'within a group.'  Often we use terms like Population, Deme, etc., but these have specific evolutionary and/or demographic meanings.  We are, however, largely ignorant if the samples we have collected are technically a part of a 'Population' in an evolutionary or at least practical random mating context.  As such, I will use the term population loosely, indicating that it is a collection of individuals sample from a geographic locale.  I am implicitly assuming a functional definition here (as I do in my research) that individuals sampled from the same 'Population' have a much higher probability of mating together than individuals sampled from different 'Populations.  This is 'Population Genetics' after all...

Here we will use the *Araptus attenuatus* co-dominant locus dataset that is included with the gstudio library.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(gstudio)
data(arapat)
```

Now the data is loaded into our session and we can extract the names of the loci (using `column_class()`, a convenience function returning the names of columns of a particular type). 

```{r}
locus_names <- column_class( arapat, "locus")
locus_names
```

Genetic diversity is estimated in R using the function `genetic_diversity()` contained within the gstudio library.  Here is the documentation for this function.  We will walk through the various parameters and illustrate their use with this dataset.

Estimate genetic diversity

Description

This function is the main one used for estimating genetic diversity among strata. Given the large number of genetic diversity metrics, not all potential types are included.

Usage
genetic_diversity(x, stratum = NULL, mode = c("A", "Ae", "A95", "He", "Ho",
  "Fis", "Pe")[2])

Arguments

x - A data.frame object with locus columns.
stratum - The strata by which the genetic distances are estimated. This can be an optional parameter when estimating distance measures calculated among individuals (default='Population').
mode - The particular genetic diversity metric that you are going to use. The gstudio package currently includes the following individual distance measures:
	A   	Number of alleles
	Ae	Effective number of alleles (default)
	A95	Number of alleles with frequency at least five percent
	He	Expected heterozygosity
	Ho	Observed heterozygosity
	Fis	Wright's Inbreeding coefficient (size corrected).
	Pe	Locus polymorphic index.

Value

A data.frame with columns for strata, diversity (mode), and potentially P(mode=0).

## Allelic Diversity

At the base level, a collection of alleles in a dataset provides an estimate of the breadth of genetic variation present. There are many measures commonly used in population genetics, though $A$, $A_{95}$, and $A_e$ are quite commonly encountered.  These terms are defined as:

*Frequency Independent Diversity* - The parameter $A$ measures the raw count of the number of alleles present in the sample.  This is a frequency independent estimate of diversity as it does not matter if the allele is only seen once or is seen hundreds of times in the sample.  

Technically, we define this parameter as  

\[
A = \ell
\]

where $\ell$ is the number of observed alleles.  We can estimate allelic diversity by passing the function either a vector of locus objects

```{r}
genetic_diversity( arapat$MP20, mode="A" )
```

or a `data.frame` that has one or more columns of data that are locus objects as determined by the `column_class()` function.  

```{r}
genetic_diversity( arapat, mode="A" )
```

The concern associated with using a parameter such as $A$ is that it throws away any information about relative abundance.  For example, a dataset with alleles found at an abundance of $N_A = 999$ and $N_B = 1$ would have the exact same frequency independent diversity as another sample with $N_A = N_B = 500$, namely $A = 2$.  

*Frequency Dependent Diversity* - A slightly more stringent approach may be to estimate the diversity of alleles in a frequency dependent fashion, specifying a particular cutoff.  The parameter $A_{95}$ is a common parameter that provides a count of the number of alleles present in a sample whose frequencies exceed a threshold of 5%.  

\[
A_{95} = \left| A_{freq(\ell)>0.05} \right|
\]

This threshold is entirely arbitrary in the same way that we use $\alpha=0.05$ as a cutoff in the teaching of formalized hypothesis testing.  It could just as easily be 3%, 1%, or 10% but has a historical trajectory  in its current form.  The $A_{95}$ parameter does remove some of the problems associated with rare alleles in our data sets as is shown by comparing the diversity of the most allele rich locus MP20 using $A$

```{r}
mp20.A <- genetic_diversity( arapat$MP20, mode="A")
mp20.A
```

and $A_{95}$

```{r}
mp20.A95 <- genetic_diversity( arapat$MP20, mode="A95")
mp20.A95
```

Here 15 of the alleles we observed in the full dataset occurred at a frequency less than 5%!

*Effective Number of Alleles* - Given the arbitrary nature of the cutoff for $A_{95}$, a more parsimonious approach may by one that measures the contribution of each allele to diversity in proportion to its frequency.  This is $A_e$ and it is defined as:

\[
A_e = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^\ell p_i^2}
\]

and is the default mode of diversity provided by the `genetic_diversity()` function (e.g., the one you get if you do not specify `mode=`).

```{r}
genetic_diversity( arapat, mode="Ae")
```

Notice that $A \ge A_e \ge A_{95}$, as $A_e$ integrates the contributions of those low frequency alleles.  None of these parameters are perfect, though all provide some measurement of diversity at the level of the allele.

## Genotypic Diversity

In addition to diversity at the level of alleles, we also can estimate diversity at the level of the genotype.  There are several parameters that can be derived for genotypic diversity but the most common are observed and expected heterozygosity.  Observed heterozygosity is simply the fraction of all genotypes in the sample that are not homozygotes.

\[
H_O = \frac{N_{ij}}{N}
\]

where $N_{ij}$ is the count of all heterozygous genotypes.  The `mode="Ho"` option in `genetic_diversity()` returns these values. 

```{r}
genetic_diversity(arapat, mode="Ho")
```

The second parameter, expected heterozygosity ($H_e$), is slightly different in that it is a parameter that needs to be estimated from data.  It represents the fraction of genotypes in the dataset that are expected to be heterozygous, if the sample is in equilibrium.  The value for this function depends upon the data that you are estimating and how it is configured.  If it is estimated from a single locale, then the parameter can be estimated directly as the expected fraction that are not homozygous.

\[
H_E = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^\ell p_i^2
\]

(where $\ell$ is the number of alleles at the locus).  Here is an example of expected heterozygosity for the LTRS and MP20 loci.

```{r}
genetic_diversity( arapat$LTRS , mode="he")
genetic_diversity( arapat$MP20, mode="he" ) 
```

In an ideal world, we would be able to have enough resources to sample for these parameters with so many individuals, they would be well behaved.  Unfortunately, we do not live in the real world and in many cases our ability to sample lots of individuals is limited.  This problem is not a new thing, we estimate the sums of square and divide by $N-1$ instead of $N$ because if we we use the later, we are producing a biased estimate.  Unless you are working with *all* the samples, every time we make population genetic inferences we will be doing so on a subsample of the total data available.  The `arapat` data set is no where near a major component of the species, it is only a sample.  From this sample, we *estimate* allele frequencies on which we derive our *estimates* of parameters such as $H_E$.  As such, if we used the formulas above to estimate everything in every study, we would have biased estimators of... pretty much everything.  However, the fix is not one that is too difficult to put in, and it has a pretty well established set of behaviors.  As such, if we are estimating these parameters in a single locale (for more than one location, we have further corrections to make), we should probably apply a small sample size correction.  In general, this correction is:

\[
\hat{H}_e = \frac{2N}{2N-1}\left[ 1-\sum_{i=1}^\ell p_i^2 \right]
\]

The front part is a small sample size correction factor.  Its importance in your estimation diminishes as $N \to \infty$ as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:biasCorrection).  Once you get above $N=9$ individuals, there is an inflation of the estimated heterozygosity at a magnitude of less than 5%. 

```{r biasCorrection, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Magnitude of the correction factor for small sample size estimations as a function of N.", message=FALSE}
require(ggplot2)
N <- 1:100
CF <- (2*N) / ( 2*N-1)
df <- data.frame( N, CF)
ggplot( df, aes(N,CF) ) + geom_line()
```



## Samples from Several Locales 

In addition to problems associated with estimating allele freqeuncies incorrectly (and requiring a sample size correction), when we estimate data from several locations, we also have a problem assocaited with the subset of locales relative to the total popualtion size, resulting in a furhter correction to account of the several biased samples you are taking.

\[
H_S = \frac{\tilde{N}}{\tilde{N}-1}\left[ 1 - \sum_{i=1}^\ell \frac{p_i^2}{K} - \frac{H_O}{2\tilde{N}} \right]
\]

where $\tilde{N}$ is the harmonic mean number of genotypes sampled across each of the $K$ strata.  Notice here I use the term $H_S$ instead of $H_E$ so that there isn't any doubt about the differences when we write and talk about these parameters.  This formulation (after Nei 1987) corrects for the sampling across separate  locations.  To indicate that your estimate is being made using subdivided groups of samples, pass the `stratum=` parameter to `genetic_diversity()` and set `mode="Hes".  We can see the magnitude of the correction by looking at a single population and comparing the estimates of $H_S$ for corrected and non-corrected parameters.

```{r}
pops <- arapat[ arapat$Population %in% c("32","101","102"),]
he <- genetic_diversity( pops, mode="He")
hes <- genetic_diversity(pops, stratum="Population", mode="Hes")[1:8,]
df <- data.frame(Locus=he[,1], He=he[,2], Hes=hes[,2])
df
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
df <- df[ !is.na(df$Hes),]
p <- format(round(cor(df$He,df$Hes),2),nsmall=3)
```


They are pretty close (Pearson's $\rho =$ `r p`), even when there are only `r nrow(pops)` individuals in the sample.^[The `NA` in the $H_{ES}$ parameter is because there are no smaples in one of the populations and a harmonic mean with a zero in it results in a divide-by-zero error.]  But they are off and this is a vitally important distinction because if you do not account for these differences you will percolate these errors up through your subsequent analyses (and this is a bad thing).

## Multilocus Diversity

There are several measures of individual locus diversity but few for multilocus diversity.  One potential measure for diversity across loci is to based upon the fraction of population that has unique multilocus genotypes.  This is defined as:

\[
D_m = \frac{N_{unique}}{N}
\]

and can be estimated using the function `mulitlocus_diversity()`.  Looking across the putative species indicated in the data set, we can see that in general, the Cape populations are much less diverse than those individuals samples throughout Baja California.

```{r}
multilocus_diversity( arapat[ arapat$Species=="Cape",])
multilocus_diversity( arapat[ arapat$Species=="Mainland",] )
multilocus_diversity( arapat[ arapat$Species=="Peninsula",] )
```

This is a pretty crude measurement but later when we examine models based upon conditional multilocus genetic distances, we need to make sure that the samples are both allelic rich and multilocus diverse and this approach is a nice way to do that.



## Rarefaction 

The primary reason for looking at diversity is to perform some comparison, which provides some insights into the biological and/or demographic processes influencing your data.  Without a basis for comparison, diversity estimates are just numbers. However, deriving an estimate of diversity is a statistical sampling process and as such we must be aware of the consequences our sampling regime has on the interpretation of the data.  This is where rarefaction comes in, a technique commonly used in ecology when comparing species richness among groups.

Here is an example of the problem sampling may interject into your analyses.   Consider a single locus with four alleles.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(gstudio)
data(arapat)
f <- data.frame( Allele=LETTERS[1:4], Frequency=0.25)
f
```

Selected as a random sample from an infinite population. The first sample has 5 individuals.

```{r}
pop1 <- make_population( f,N=5)
ae1 <- genetic_diversity( pop1, mode="Ae" )
ae1
```

And the second one has 100 individuals.

```{r}
pop2 <- make_population( f, N=100 )
ae2 <- genetic_diversity( pop2 )
ae2
```

The difference in estimated diversity among these groups are `abs( ae1 - ae2 ) = 0.15`.  Is this statistically different or are they the same?  Is it just because we sampled more individuals in the second set that we get higher values of $A_e$? Consider the `MP20` locus in the beetle data set, it has a total of 19 alleles present.  If we subsample this data and estimate the number of observed alleles, we see that there is an asymptotic relationship between sampling effort and estimates of allelic diversity.  Here is the code for estimating frequency independent diversity, $A$, using these data.

```{r}
loci <- arapat$MP20
sz <- c(2,5,10,15,20,50,100)
sample_sizes <- rep( sz, each=20 )
Ae <- rep(NA,length(sample_sizes))
for( i in 1:length(Ae)){
  loci <- sample( loci, size=length(loci), replace=FALSE)
  Ae[i] <- genetic_diversity( loci[1:sample_sizes[i]], mode="Ae" )$Ae
}
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
df <- data.frame( Sample_Size=factor(sample_sizes), Ae )
ggplot( df, aes(x=Sample_Size, y=Ae)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_bw() + xlab("Population Sample Size (N)") + ylab("Effective Allelic Diversity (Ae)")
```

The ‘curvy' nature of this relationship shows a few things.  

It takes a moderate sample size to capture the main set of alleles in the data set.  If we are looking at allocating sampling using only 5 individuals per locale, then we are not going to get the majority of the alleles present.

For the rare alleles, you really need to grab large at-site samples if estimates of diversity are the main component of what you are doing.  Do rare alleles aid in uncovering the biological processes you are interested in studying?  They may or may not.

For most purposes, we will use all the samples we have collected.  In many cases though, some locales may not have as many samples as other ones.  So, even with these data, if I have one locale with 10 samples and another with 50, how can I determine if the differences observed are due to true differences in the underlying diversity and which are from my sampling?  Just as in testing for HWE, we can use our new friend permutation to address the differences.

Rarefaction is the process of subsampling a larger dataset in smaller chunks such that we can estimate diversity among groups using the same number of individuals.  Here is an example in the beetle dataset where I am going to look at differences in diversity among samples ($N = 75$) collected in the cape regions of Baja California 

```{r}
ae.cape <- genetic_diversity( arapat[ arapat$Species=="Cape", "WNT"] )
ae.cape
```

and compare those to the genetic diversity observed from a smaller collection of individuals sampled from mainland Mexico ($N=36$).

```{r}
ae.mainland <- genetic_diversity( arapat[ arapat$Species=="Mainland", "WNT"] )$Ae
ae.mainland
```

The observed difference in effective allelic diversity, $A_{e,mainland} == A_{e,cape}$, could be because the Cape region of Baja California is more diverse or it could be because there are twice as many individuals in that sample.   

To perform a rarefaction on these data, we do the following:  

1. Use the size of the smallest population ($N$) as the sample size for all estimates.
Randomly sample individuals, without replacement, from the larger dataset in allocations of size $N$.  
2. Estimate diversity parameters on these subsamples and repeat to create a 'null distribution' of estimated diversity values.  
3. Compare your observed value in the smallest population to that distribution created by subsampling the larger population.  

From the data set, this is done by

```{r}
cape.pop <- arapat[ arapat$Species=="Cape","WNT"]
null.ae <- rarefaction( cape.pop, mode="Ae",size=36)
mean(null.ae)
```

So even if the samples sizes are the same, the mean level of diversity remains relatively constant.  The range in diversity

```{r}
range(null.ae)
```

is quite large.  Since this estimate is frequency based, random samples of alleles change the underlying estimate of Ae during each permutation.  

The observed estimate of diversity in the Mainland populations does fall within this range.  However, the null hypothesis states that $A_{e,mainland} = A_{e,cape}$ and if this is true, once we standardize sample size, we can take the distribution of permuted Ae values as a statement about what we should see if the null hypothesis were true.  As such, we can treat it probabilistically and estimate the probability that $A_e$, Mainland is drawn from this distribution.

```{r}
all.ae <- c( null.ae, ae.mainland)
P <- sum(ae.mainland <= null.ae) / ( length(all.ae) )
P
```

Or graphically, it can be depicted as below.

```{r echo=FALSE}
df <- data.frame( Observation = c(rep("Permuted",length(null.ae)),"Observed"),
                  Value = all.ae )
ggplot( df, aes(x=Value, fill=Observation)) + geom_histogram(bins=30) + theme_bw() + xlab("Allelic Diversity") + ylab("Frequency")
```


## Mapping Diversity

Estimating diversity is great and being able to compare two or more groups for their levels of diversity is even better.  But often we are looking for spatial patterns in our data.  Both R and gstudio provide easy interfaces for plotting data and later in the text we will see how to integrate raster and vector data into our workflows for more sublime approaches to characterizing population genetic processes.  In the mean time, it is amazingly easy to use basic plotting commands to get pretty informative output.  In this example, I extract the mean coordinate of each stratum in the arapat dataset and then estimate diversity at the level of these partitions and merge the diversity estimates for the AML locus into the coordinate data.frame.  

```{r}
library(gstudio)
data(arapat)
diversity <- genetic_diversity(arapat, stratum="Population", mode="Ae")
coords <- strata_coordinates(arapat)
coords <- merge( coords, diversity[ diversity$Locus == "AML", ] )
```

Then, I grab a map from the Google server and map my populations with diversity depicted as differences in the size of the points.  Note that the `ggmap()` function provides the base map that is retrieved but when we use `geom_point()` we need to specify the `aes()` and the `data=` part as these data are from the `data.frame` we made, not from the map we grabbed from Google.

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(ggmap)
map <- population_map(coords)
ggmap(map) + geom_point( aes(x=Longitude,y=Latitude,size=Ae), data=coords)
```
