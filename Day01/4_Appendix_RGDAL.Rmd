# RGDAL & RGEOS {-}

Every time I upgrade R in any significant way, two libraries seem to raise their ugly heads and scream like a spoiled childâ€”--*rgdal* and *rgeos*.  Why do these two have to be SOOOO much of a pain? Why can't we have a auto build of a binary with all the options in it for OSX? Who knows? I always feel like I get the fuzzy end of the lollipop with these two. Here is my latest approach for getting them going.

First you have to make sure you have the latest GDAL libraries. I used to get mine from [Kyngchaos](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks), just download the framework, install it, and then do some kind of long R CMD INSTALL dance, which seems to no longer work for me. I also tried installing from Ripley's repository and found that (a) It was a version older than the one I already had on my machine, and (b) you can't install from that repository, there is a malformed header and the install.packages() function just barfs.

Time to try something new. I typically stay away from the various installer frameworks out there on OSX to keep everything in Frameworks. But this time, I used MacPorts. You can find the latest version here. Here is how I got it to help me out.  

- Download XCode from Apple, it is both free and has a lot of tools that make your life as a programmer easier.  It is a big package and you'll have to install the command line developer tools as well.  You will be prompted on how to do this.
- Downloaded the version of macports for your OS, I'm currently on 10.11 and installed it with little problems.  It takes a bit of time at the end of the installation because it is downloading a lot of information.  Be patient. 
- In the terminal, I updated it `sudo ports -v selfupdate` and again be patient, it is going to grab a lot of stuff from the internet.
- I then used it to install `gdal` as a unix library (rather than as a framework so it won't be located in /Library/Frameworks) by sudo ports install `gdal`. There were a lot of dependencies for this one so it took a while.
- I then had R install rgdal as `install.packages( rgdal, type="source")`

Worked like a charm.
